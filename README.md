# Awoo Theme
This is my personal theme for VS Code

### Installing
It is available through the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=code-bizarre.awoo-theme) through the browser, or through the in-app extensions search. 

If for some reason you'd rather install from the command line: `code --install-extension code-bizarre.awoo-theme`

I accept suggestions and constructive criticism.

Screenshots below.

A port for sublime text tmTheme can be found [Here](https://mega.nz/file/uK4AWKzK#_ZRCX-gTyq54o6lXUSsWUcgO2QFABSrePYU-VpQ46Vg) but I cannot make any guarantee about how good it will work or look.
